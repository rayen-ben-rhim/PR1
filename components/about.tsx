        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a tech enthusiast and developer passionate about
        creating innovative solutions and making everyday tasks simpler and smarter.  
        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Accounting</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        , but Iâ€™m also exploring new tools like Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Iâ€™m the creator of the <span className="font-medium">AI Expenses Tracking App</span>, 
        a project aimed at helping users manage their finances through intelligent insights. 
        I also enjoy exploring game development, like my ongoing <span className="font-medium">password game</span> project, 
        and growing my <span className="font-medium">motivation-focused Instagram account</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        <span className="italic">When Iâ€™m not coding</span>, I enjoy playing video games, 
        watching movies, and learning new skills like guitar and studying{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">history and philosophy</span>. 
        My ultimate goal is to create tools that make technology more personalized 
        and accessible for everyone.
